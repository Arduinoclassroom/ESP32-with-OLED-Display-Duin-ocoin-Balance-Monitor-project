# ESP32-with-OLED-Display-Duin-ocoin-Balance-Monitor-project
My name is **Oshan Dissanayaka**. I am a student of the school. My latest is the **ESP32 with OLED Display Duino-coin Balance Monitor**. In this I have created the **Duino-coin** logo first and your **Duino-coin Username**, **Minners**, **Hashrate** and **duino-coin balance**. This will refresh every 5 seconds. I have a Youtube channel. If possible, subscribe to it as a help. This is My YouTube channel. "[**Arduino classroom**](www.youtube.com/Arduinoclassroom)". Thanks.
